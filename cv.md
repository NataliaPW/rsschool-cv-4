From school I was connected with programming. So, at school I was in a specialized class, in which there was an in-depth study of mathematics and computer science; graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics and developed software products to automate my workplace; by type of activity, associated with the preparation of industrial enterprises for automation for the Digital Economy 4.0 (establishment of business processes) and the subsequent development of appropriate ERP systems. 
During my studies, I became interested in website development. So, currently I have developed [my portfolio website](http://s29645vv.beget.tech/), where individual works are posted.
